# py-311-gradient-base
This was pretty much copy-and-pasted
from https://github.com/gradient-ai/base-container/tree/main/all-pt200-tf212-jax048-py311.

#### Key changes:

- Defaulted to use the jammy dist since it comes with python 3.10
- Removed custom cmake build since I don't see a valid reason for it 🤷‍♂️.
